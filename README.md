# Fungi_Species_Growth_Stage_Recognition_Deep_Learning
Multi-head Image Classification Using Deep Neural Networks

The Experiment of Model Comparisons was completed.

The test accuracy about species is: 99.0279%

The test accuracy about time is: 99.5140%

Therefore, we can use deep learning methods to identify fungi species without using a DNA analyzer
